## Overview
AutoSCORE is a rubric-aligned, multi-agent LLM framework designed to enhance automated scoring of student responses. It consists of two cooperating agents: a Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent that identifies rubric-relevant evidence and encodes it into structured representations, and a Scoring Agent that predicts scores based on these components. This design bridges the gap between language model reasoning and human rubric-based grading. We conduct experiments on four public datasets from the ASAP suite using multiple LLMs (GPT-4o, LLaMA-8B, LLaMA-70B). Results demonstrate that AutoSCORE achieves superior reliability and validity across scoring tasks, improving interpretability, robustness, and scalability compared to single-agent baselines.

Overview of the proposed AutoSCORE multi-agent framework. The Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent
identifies rubric-aligned components from the task context and student response, producing a structured representation Z. The
Scoring Agent leveraged this representation together with the original inputs to assign the final score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Dependencies (see requirements.txt)


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AI4STEM-Education-Center/AutoSCORE.git
cd AutoSCORE
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The data processing and scoring procedures are highly similar across all datasets. Therefore, we present **ASAP-SAS2** as an example in the usage instructions below. All prompt templates used in our experiments are publicly available in the `prompts/` directory. The framework can be easily adapted to other datasets by modifying the component extraction logic in the corresponding scripts.

### Single-Agent Scoring System

Using GPT-4:
```bash
python asap_sas_single_agent_gpt4o.py
```

Using Llama 70B:
```bash
python asap_sas_single_agent_llama70b.py
```

### Multi-Agent Scoring System

Using GPT-4:
```bash
python asap_sas_multi_agent_gpt4o.py
```

Using Llama 70B:
```bash
python asap_sas_multi_agent_llama70b.py
```
